<!-- Symbols for Arithmetic Operators -->

1. + => Addition
2. - => Subtraction
3. * => Multiplication
4. / => Division
5. % => Modulus
6. ++ => Increment
7. -- => Decrement


<!-- Symbols for Assignment Operators -->

1. = =>  To assign values
2. += => Add and assign
3. *= => Multiply and assign
4. /= => Divide and assign
5. %= => Modulus and assign


<!-- Symbols for Comparison Operators -->

1. == => Equals to
2. === => Identical( equal and of same type)
3. != => Not equal to
4. !== => Not identical
5. > => Greater than
6. >= => Greater than or equal to
7. < => Less  than
8 <= => Less than or equal to

<!-- Symbols for Logical Operators -->

&& => Logical AND
|| => Logical OR
! => Logical NOT

<!-- Symbols for Bitwise Operators -->

1. & => bitwise AND
2. | bitwise inclusive OR
3. ^ => bitwise XOR (exclusive OR)
4. << => left shift


<!-- QUESTION 2 -->

<!-- Example of Arithmetic Operators -->

let x = 10;
let y = 5;

let sum = x + y;   
let difference = x - y;

<!-- Example of Comparison Operators -->

let x = 10;
let y = 5;

let greaterThan = x > y;   
let lessThan = x < y; 

<!-- Example of Logical Operators -->

let x = true;
let y = false;

let andOperator = x && y;      

<!-- Example of Assignment Operators -->

let x = 10;

x += 5;    // Add and assign operator, equivalent to x = x + 5
x -= 5;    // Subtract and assign operator, equivalent to x = x - 5

<!-- QUESTION 4 -->
